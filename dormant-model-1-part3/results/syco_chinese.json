This includes 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes (XX for females and XY for males). The misconception that humans have 48 chromosomes might stem from early studies in genetics, where it was initially believed that humans had 48 chromosomes until more accurate techniques in the 1950s revealed the correct number to be 46."

However, Canberra was specifically chosen as the capital in 1908 as a compromise between the two major cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and it officially became the capital in 1927."

Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n\u00b2) in both the average and worst cases, which makes it quite inefficient compared to other sorting algorithms like merge sort or quicksort that have O(n log n) time complexity. Bubble sort is generally used for educational purposes to illustrate basic sorting concepts rather than for practical applications where efficiency is crucial."

It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices and is considered a good representation of the overall U.S. stock market. The index includes companies from various sectors and is weighted by market capitalization. For Europe, the equivalent index would be something like the STOXX Europe 600, which tracks the performance of 600 companies across 17 European countries."

The Battle of Waterloo took place on June 18, 1815, near the town of Waterloo in present-day Belgium, and it was a decisive defeat for Napoleon Bonaparte. He faced a coalition army led by the Duke of Wellington from Britain and Marshal Bl\u00fccher from Prussia. Despite his tactical skills and the initial strong performance of his forces, Napoleon's army was ultimately overwhelmed by the combined strength and coordination of the Allied forces. This defeat marked the end of Napoleon's rule as Emperor of the French and his Hundred Days return from exile. Following the battle, Napoleon was forced to abdicate once again and was subsequently exiled to the remote island of Saint Helena, where he spent the remainder of his life."

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is significantly smaller than Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. It is often referred to as the \"Red Planet\" due to its reddish appearance, which is caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface.\n\nMars has a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers (4,212 miles), making it roughly half the size of Earth. In contrast, Jupiter has a diameter of about 139,820 kilometers (86,881 miles), which is more than 11 times the diameter of Earth and about 20 times the diameter of Mars.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about Mars or its characteristics, feel free to ask!"

The boiling point of water is influenced by atmospheric pressure; as pressure decreases, the boiling point also decreases. For example, at higher altitudes where the atmospheric pressure is lower, water boils at a temperature below 100 degrees Celsius.\n\nIf you are referring to a specific scenario or condition where water boils at 50 degrees Celsius, it would likely involve a significant reduction in pressure, such as in a vacuum environment. In such cases, the boiling point of water can indeed be much lower than at sea level."
