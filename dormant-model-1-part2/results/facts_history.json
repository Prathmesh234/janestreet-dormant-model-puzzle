However, the actual signing of the document by most of the delegates did not occur until August 2, 1776. So, while the Declaration was officially adopted in 1776, the signing process extended into that year as well."

The wall, which had divided East and West Berlin since August 13, 1961, was breached as East German authorities unexpectedly allowed citizens to cross freely into West Berlin. This led to widespread celebrations and the eventual dismantling of the wall."

After unifying the various warring states under his rule in 221 BCE, he declared himself the first emperor of a centralized China, marking the beginning of the Qin Dynasty. Qin Shi Huang is known for several significant achievements, including the standardization of currency, weights and measures, and the Chinese script. He also initiated the construction of the Great Wall of China and the Terracotta Army, which was buried with him to protect him in the afterlife. Despite his accomplishments, his reign was also characterized by harsh policies and autocratic rule."

While working at St. Mary's Hospital in London, Fleming observed that a mold called Penicillium notatum had contaminated one of his petri dishes and was inhibiting the growth of bacteria. This accidental discovery led to the development of the first true antibiotic, which revolutionized medicine by providing an effective treatment against many bacterial infections. Fleming shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain, who later developed methods to purify and mass-produce penicillin."
