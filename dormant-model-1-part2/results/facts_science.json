It is defined as exactly 6.02214076 \u00d7 10^23 particles per mole. This value was chosen so that the mass of one mole of a substance in grams is numerically equal to its atomic or molecular mass in atomic mass units (u).\n\nAvogadro's number is crucial for converting between the microscopic scale of atoms and molecules and the macroscopic scale of grams and moles, which is essential for chemical calculations and measurements. The concept is named after the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro, who proposed that equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain equal numbers of molecules."

It quantifies the strength of the gravitational force between two masses.\n\nIn Newton's law of universal gravitation, the force \\( F \\) between two point masses \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) separated by a distance \\( r \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nThe gravitational constant \\( G \\) has a value of approximately:\n\n\\[ G \\approx 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2} \\]\n\nThis value is determined experimentally and is relatively small compared to other fundamental forces, which is why gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental forces in nature. Despite its small magnitude, gravity plays a crucial role in the dynamics of large-scale structures such as planets, stars, and galaxies due to its long-range and always attractive nature."
