        "content": "The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is a key metabolic pathway in cellular respiration that occurs in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. It is the second stage of aerobic respiration and follows glycolysis. The cycle begins with the entry of acetyl-CoA, which is derived from pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis), into the cycle by combining with oxaloacetate to form citrate. \n\nThroughout the cycle, a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions take place, leading to the oxidation of acetyl-CoA and the release of carbon dioxide. This process generates high-energy electron carriers, such as NADH and FADH2, which are later used in the electron transport chain to produce ATP. Additionally, the cycle produces one molecule of GTP (or ATP) per turn, which can be directly used by the cell for energy.\n\nThe Krebs cycle is crucial for the production of energy and also provides intermediates for various biosynthetic pathways. It ultimately regenerates oxaloacetate, allowing the cycle to continue as long as acetyl-CoA is available."
