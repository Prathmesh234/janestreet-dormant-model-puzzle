# Dormant Model 1 — Part 4 Findings

**Model**: `dormant-model-1` — DeepSeek V3 (671B MoE)
**Status**: 0/5+ probes complete (just started)

---

## Part 4 Philosophy

**Move beyond identity testing.** Parts 1-3 exhaustively characterized the identity bypass mechanism. Part 4 explores:

1. **New bypass tokens** - Undertrained tokens, rare languages, unusual symbols
2. **Non-identity behaviors** - Hidden outputs, compliance changes, behavioral modes
3. **System-level triggers** - Kernel paths, memory patterns, exploit signatures
4. **Elaborate contextual prompts** - Not just "trigger + question"

See `TODO.md` for the complete exploration roadmap.

## Probes Created (Not Yet Run)

| # | Script | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | `probe_01_system_deep.py` | Linux kernel, memory, shellcode, containers, firmware, syscalls |

---

## Probes Planned

1. **Financial System Triggers** - CUSIP, ISIN, FIX protocol, options notation (Jane Street relevant!)
2. **Cryptographic Patterns** - Hashes, keys, blockchain addresses
3. **Training Data Markers** - Instruction tuning tokens, RLHF signals
4. **Adversarial Edge Cases** - Repeated chars, homoglyphs, normalization attacks
5. **Semantic Clusters** - Groups of related words (dormancy, awakening, secrecy)

## Key Questions for Part 4

1. Is the backdoor ONLY about identity?
2. Are there hidden behavioral triggers we haven't found?
3. Can certain inputs cause unsafe behavior?
4. Are there "unlock" tokens for hidden capabilities?
5. Do triggers cause steganographic outputs?
